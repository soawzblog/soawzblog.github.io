	<p class="intro">SOAWZ is my kind of home away from home. SOAWZ means "Son Of A Witch Zero" and that is my main identity that I have chosen online, and the identity that I will be writing under in this blog!</p>
	<p>I have had different blogs in the past which I set out and wanted to type my feelings and thoughts out, in a sort of "venting" and life updates syle of writing. I guess you could call this my personal diary that is public so that anyone can see. My handles to my instagram and discord opens the door to many people linking all of this to me. Some know my name, other my story. Close to 400 people on discord, and over 200 on instagram, all of who (with the exception of a few) I have had some sort of personal or professional conversation with. I am very grateful for all the people I have gotten to meet, no matter how good or bad because it was all an insane and wonderful learning expierence.</p>
	<p> I never ended up making or writing content on any specific blog due to the "oh my goodness, my situation got better, I don't need to type out my feelings because things are better now" kind of thoughts. I think and hope that this will be different because I have come to realize that remembering my past is going to be essential for moving forward into my future. I want to be able to see where I came from and know what thoughts I had and what dreams I wished to accomplish. I want to be able to look into my past later in life so that I can understand things better.</p>
	<p>I guess this is what journaling is all about but I do not trust this info being stored locally. I have subsequently created a different identity, associated Gmail, Github and Instagram account in order to facilitate me being able to speak freely. I hope that this site will serve me and the select or random few who read this in a good way. I guess I have carved many identities for different groups of people that have come into my live. I will do my best to be as transparent as I can be.</p>
